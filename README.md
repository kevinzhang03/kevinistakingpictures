# iambuildingwebsite

As you know, I am super into photography and I want a place to share my work. Instagram would be a nice place, if it weren't for its emphasis on video content and their algorithms that will screw me over. Now we have this.

This is actually version 2 of my site. The one you see on https://kevinzhangtt.github.io/kevinistakingpictures-legacy is my old one, built on pure HTML and CSS only. All of my pictures were hosted in the website repository because I couldn't find a better way to host them.. I recently learned React from other projects I'm working on, and I think this would be a good opportunity to use those skills to make a better site.

I have a LOT planned for this new and improved site like a blog and store (if people like my work enough :sob:) but for now I just want to create a place for people like you to look at my photos.
