        Welcome to my site! It ain't much, but it's my little passion project and I'm glad to have at
        least something up and running on the internet. Please don't mind the dust, the site is still in
        its very early stages and is being worked on. However, the important part is that it allows you
        to view my work with a mildly decent user experience :)
